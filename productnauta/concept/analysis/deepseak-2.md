### 1. AI.gov.uk/blogs 
- **Focus**: Government policy and reflections on AI in product management
- **Content Type**: Blog articles
- **Target Audience**: Government PMs and policymakers

- **Content Type**: Blog/thought leadership
- **Target Audience**: Mid-to-senior level PMs

- **Content Type**: SaaS tool
- **Target Audience**: Early-stage PMs and startups
- **Strengths**: Well-defined focus (PRD automation), user-friendly interface

- **Content Type**: Newsletters + blog
- **Target Audience**: PMs and product leaders
